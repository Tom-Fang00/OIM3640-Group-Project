# OIM3640-Group-Project
This is the repository for group Alex Z, Jiaying T, Tom Fang

For our project, we created a website to generate a meal recommendation for the user based on their inputs one main ingredient, category (like breakfast, dessert, seafood, vegetarian), and the second optional input the region (like American, Italian, Chinese), all of which are mandatory, or else the website will throw an error. Our team found the API called TheMealDB, which is an open-source database for recipes. There are no special packages required to be installed to run our code. First, we start with a function to get a list of categories. Then, we have a function to get a list of areas (region). There is also a function to get a list of ingredients. We used the list of categories and areas to create an index.html for our website, allowing users to select from a dropdown. The ingredient input can be inputted by the user, and if it does not exist, our website will return an error. 

To run the code, first download all pages, including two py docs and one html. run the app.py doc, and get the following result.

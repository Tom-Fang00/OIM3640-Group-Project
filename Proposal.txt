For our project, we will be making a recipe generator off an database of some sort(We haven't decided on the exact one yet). Tom will be in charge of the web design using the flask function, since he is the only one who have taken the WebTech class. Emma and Alex will be working on the python part. We expect to deliver a website like: https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/WNeggor.

On the final UI website, we expect to be able to display calorie count, ingredients list, as well as a video on youtube showing the cooking process. In addition, we will try to make a feature displaying the online review of this dish.
